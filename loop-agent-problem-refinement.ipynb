    "\n",
    "**Use loop agents to continuously refine industry problems through critic feedback.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a **loop agent workflow** that iteratively refines industry problems. Instead of a one-shot analysis, a critic agent repeatedly reviews and eliminates weak or non-existent problems until only the most significant, location-specific challenges remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Finder Agent** - Discovers problems in a specific industry within a city\n",
    "2. **Critic Agent** (Loop) - Reviews problems and eliminates minimal/non-existent ones\n",
    "3. **Final Output** - Clean list of real, substantial problems with one-sentence descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Loop?** Problems need multiple passes of validation and refinement to ensure accuracy. The critic agent continuously improves the list until high-quality problems remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:** Market research, business opportunity analysis, location-based problem-solution matching."
